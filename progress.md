- [x] Basic project structure established

### 2. Authentication System
- [x] Supabase client configuration with environment variable validation
- [x] Auth component created with sign up/login functionality
- [x] Session management implemented in main App component
- [x] Protected routing logic (basic session check)
- [x] Error handling for authentication flows
- [x] Loading states for better UX

### 3. UI Components

- [ ] Data visualization (charts/graphs)
- [ ] Expense history/list view

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Budget setting and tracking
- [ ] Recurring expense management
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness optimization

### Phase 4: Database Integration
- [ ] Supabase database schema design

## Known Issues
- Environment variables need to be configured for Supabase connection
- Email confirmation may be required depending on Supabase settings

## Technical Debt
- Consider implementing proper TypeScript types for Supabase responses
- Add form validation beyond basic required fields
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add unit tests for components
